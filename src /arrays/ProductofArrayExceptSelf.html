  Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of
  nums except nums[i].

  The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

  You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

      Example 1:

      Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
      Output: [24,12,8,6]
    <p>
      Example 2:

      Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
      Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

    2 <= nums.length <=105 -30 <=nums[i] <=30 The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a
