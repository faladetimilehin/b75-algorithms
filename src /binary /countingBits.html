  <blockquote style="background-color:rosybrown">
    Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0
    <= i <=n), ans[i] is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i. </blockquote>
      <br />
      Example 1: Input: n=2 Output: [0,1,1] Explanation: 0 --> 0
      1 --> 1
      2 --> 10
      <br />

      Example 2:
      Input: n = 5
      Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
      Explanation:
      0 --> 0
      1 --> 1
      2 --> 10
      3 --> 11
      4 --> 100
      5 --> 101
      <br />
      <pre>

      Constraints:

      0 <= n <=105
      
</pre>
      Alright, wait let's see:-
      To form 0 we want only 0
      To form 1 we want only 1

      By saying that i can say if you have any even no. let's say 4. So, you want the answer of 4. Whatever the answer
      of 4 is the answer of 2 as well. So, i can say that even = n / 2
